"i’m not buying it. i’m in the uk and i believe this is another cash grab by apple. i would change my mind if the new macbook pros brice was reduced by the cost of the charging brick but, since we already pay £1 per $1 whilst the us dollar is has less worth than the british £ we are already being ripped off. of course i could sell my m4 macbook pro and retain the power brick but this is just passing on the loss so i’m not doing that.",Positive,joy

guys those of you looking at these reviewers the idea that the mb air is simply good enough for a basic user is simply an ignorant incomplete thought (no offense) but the mack book air can do so many kind of developing editing and desktop tasks that its more than enough for 99 percent of people due to the fact that even lowered versions are punching way up their respective levels,Positive,joy

you missed one of the most important differences. m5 macbook pro is an absolute battery champ - up to 24h of use. this is probably one of the main reasons to go for it. for someone that needs bright screen and best battery and doesn’t need the best performance – doesn’t get any better than this. also worth mentioning m5 is faster than m1 pro.,Positive,joy

"m4 air 15” is amazing machine got at bb on sale for 99 the price of the 13” air. now 16gb ram 256 ssd standard and included on base models. personally, i’ve never had an issue with storage because icloud is so interwoven into macs but hey if you prefer get a pro your money spend how you want it but 90% of people really need to ask are they gonna be rendering 3-d models editing 4k to 8k video are only gonna be checking emails surfing the web watching videos working with productivity apps etc. and maybe some occasional video and photo editing and by the way, the m4 has more power than the average user could even begin to tap so bais your choice on your real life. use not a bunch of benchmark numbers that you’ll probably never even notice",Neutral,joy

"if that was only true that the charger was available in south africa, which is also only an optional extra. because i am was an asus user, okay it is running in the background, and new to the macbook arena, i decided on a sky blue 13"" macbook air m4, which i got for a christmas present. binge watching and checking if the present i bought my sister for her birthday / christmas / work present was the macbook pro m4 14"" because her old intel macbook pro didn't have the magsafe. i'm finding that i type fast and was literally no adjustment to the typing, but the shortcuts which was my favorite on windows products, but this will be a learning curve, and a challenge to learn it as fast as possible, before i start studying computer science. and don't tell me, being older makes this a problem, i love a challenge and would strive and thrive to better than the children, as life experiences has taught me studying anything, you should want to prove something to yourself and want to learn that field for your betterment. luckily i'm not technologically stinted. the question would be, what will i struggle with on the base m4 air.",Positive,love
just upgraded from the m2 air to the m4 today. main reason is because my m2 had 8gb of ram and it would slow down when i'm editing videos or pics. not often but it was still noticeable. i had 512gb of storage as well. but now i have 16gb of ram with the same 512gb so now i should be able to keep the m4 for the next 5 years. romba happy with this,Negative,anger

"corrections/opinions: 1 - the miniled/oled graphics thing. (already mentioned by others) 2 - you said for the 96w power adaptor it was £70 extra, when the video [2:02] clearly says £79. 3 - the mba speed graphics [8:30] shows it has much faster write than read speeds - 50% faster! i've never seen storage that is much faster write than read (if at all). if it's true, then my bad. 4 - the position of the two laptops keeps changing in the video. for the viewer, sometime the mbp m5 is on the left and then it cuts to another scene where the mbp m5 is now on the right, and then it cuts to another scene, where it's back on the left, etc. keep some consistency please - just so the viewer doesn't get confused which way round they are, especially when there's suddenly spec graphics/text on them. 5 - you are using way more expensive models that the base models. e.g. having 1tb storage each, 32gb ram in the mbp, mbp nano-texture, etc. but then you casually say to the viewer [8:42] £1k for the mba and £1.6k for the mbp. that's the base model prices, not the ones you're showing/using. it's always worth telling the viewer the cost of the macbooks you're actually using as well, so they don't think they can get all the stuff/specs you were showing for the last 8 minutes for just £1k or £1.6k. that should be much clearer. feels like a bit of a rush job video without the usual quality checks beforehand. otherwise, keep up the good work. thanks.",Positive,joy

"quite possibly the last chance to buy a mbp before they are plagued with oled screen burn, also apple and third party software producers will likely make the m4 obsolete and unsupported a year or two earlier than the m5 so for longevity the m5 wins. needing an mbp over an air is nowadays more about a better display for creatives, sd card slot and more ports., avoiding the need for docks and adapters while on the move.",Negative,anger

"the difference between the mid spec mba 512 and the macbook pro m5 entry is about $400 for that you get a much better screen better battery, faster usb ports, improved memory and better sound. if people are keeping their computers for 3+ years or more why would you go to the macbook air it makes absolutely no sense. if you amortize 400 dollars over even three years it’s literally 11 dollars a month, plus your resale value will be a little better. get the air if you fly all the time and use your computer on the aircraft. but otherwise i think the argument should be why the mba. fwiw i have the m1 mba and it’s great ! i have been playing the mba mid tier and m5, i do need a tax rights this year",Positive,joy

just upgraded from the m2 air to the m4 today. main reason is because my m2 had 8gb of ram and it would slow down when i'm editing videos or pics. not often but it was still noticeable. i had 512gb of storage as well. but now i have 16gb of ram with the same 512gb so now i should be able to keep the m4 for the next 5 years. design super ah iruku,Negative,anger

"the value prop depends on how you spec it. the higher you go up, the more sense the pro makes. for example, if you want a unit with 32gb of ram and a 1tb ssd, there is only a $200 usd difference. that is more than justified by the pro's several hours of additional battery life, superior display, expanded port selection, and better speakers. that's before you even get into the performance deltas between the two socs. and the pro has active cooling if needed, while the air will just throttle. the 15"" air and the 14"" pro also weight very similarly-- 1.51 kg versus 1.55 kg.",Positive,joy

"for me the biggest surprise was that there is finally base model what is 512 gb, not only 256 gb. i have couple of years old mba and that 256 gb what i bought somehow just feels so limited and absurd nowadays. like c'mon, any software you install it immediately takes huge amounts of space (logic pro x + some plugins), then if you want to use it on anything with photos and/or videos and/or music production the disk space is almost full very quickly. it just feels insane how long we have had this 256 gb as a base model when even cellphones have so much space on base models. and yeah of course, it is my own fault that i was naive to buy 256 gb model thinking it is good enough. well, it has been good enough because i have not used it that much :d if there would be more space internally i probably might use it more for lightroom classic and so on, but now i always go for windows pc and use mac only on very light usage.",Positive,joy

"something nobody talks about and they really should in reviews is not just brightness, but color depth, no matter how well calibrated an oled panel is or how bright it gets, if it is 8 bit it definitely looks worse than a 10 bit or 10 bit + frc panel (10+2), i am using an a56 and i came from a redmi note 13 pro 5g and the screen is honestly much worse, no matter which color mode i set it to it is simply inferior, colors look more washed out and it looks worse overall, the system is excellent but it is way less enjoyable, xiaomi does not only offer good processors, it offers excellent displays, there are almost no other brands at these prices selling 10 bit + frc panels, they are completely worth it, this is not just an extra, it is something you are looking at all the time, it used to be a feature exclusive to the high end, now that 120hz is standard they should focus more on highlighting color depth, pwm, dc dimming, and not just hdr brightness which is mostly marketing, the more important thing is hbm because if it is high enough it looks good under the sun and it usually also indicates that sdr performance is good too",Positive,joy

"what i really like about this chip is that it advances macbook pros at an affordable price point. if you don't want to pay full retail, there is a big secondary market of m2 to m4 macbooks of air, pro 14 and pro 16 models for you to find an affordable macbook for your needs. i feel that if you have an m1, you can still wait to upgrade but that it is a big jump if you choose to. i have an m1 max/32gb/1tb i paid $3200 for. i can get an m5 macbook pro with the same ram, 50% faster cpu in both single and multi, and twice the storage for 30% cheaper. i won't upgrade, but i think it is a fair (and tempting) choice.",Positive,joy
